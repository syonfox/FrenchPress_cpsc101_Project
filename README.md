Organization
------------------
In order to keep out stuff organized please keep all java files in `src` and compile them to `bin` you can do this by being in the `bin` folder when you compile and running `javac ../src/*.java` this will place the compiled files in the `bin` folder. 

In order to stop us from working on the same think or making incomparable code we should know what the others are doing.  by using waffle.io we should be able to see when other people are working on something and what they are working on so we can talk and make sure that nothing will be incomparable.  The link for waffle.io is in the Facebook chat.  if you make a new file you can add it as an issue.  When you start editing a file move it to in progress and when you stop working on it move it back to ready.  if it is finished move it over to done. we can also make issues for other things if we need help and even assign people to specific issues.


Policys
---------
###Documentation
Documentation is an important part of the project, make sure you fully comment your code if your not sure weather or not there should be a comment make one.

there will be a `doc` folder for putting documentation files. I am not positive on what we should use it for but it is there. 

We should also attempt to use java-docs, it makes a nice html website explaining how all of our classes work and will be useful for using each others classes.  the java-docs can most likely be in `doc/javadocs/`.

###Formating
Make sure your code is nicely formatted use the white space rule and put effor into making it readable as others will have to read and understand it and we want that to be as easy as possible.
